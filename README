FILES: 
thread.h -- Definition of the Thread struct
thread.cpp -- Implementation of the Thread struct
scheduler.h -- Definition of the Scheduler class
scheduler.cpp -- Implementation of the Scheduler class
uthreads.cpp -- Implementation of the uthreads library

REMARKS:
*Notice - using c11++ on a cool data structure we made up , check it out !

*Including scheduler.h spawns a single GLOBAL scheduler called __schd , creating any variable with 
the same name could (and probably would) result in serious problems. the scheduler is a static singleton and 
must be spawned for anything to work! this is done because it is impossible to set a signal handler to a 
non-static member method in C++. In general we wouldn't recommend (for future students) to build this project
in C++ jumping aroung data structures can create havoc in the stack since some behavior is undefined in C++
when using this function. (at least according to stackoverflow.org) and things can get realy messy when 
trying to jump into member methods.
